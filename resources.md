# Additional Resources on Zero‑Knowledge Proofs

This page lists some of the articles, tutorials and open source projects I found most helpful while studying zero‑knowledge proofs.  The landscape is evolving quickly – these references were up to date as of **October 2025**.

## Videos & courses

- **Cyfrin Updraft** – [Fundamentals of Zero‑Knowledge Proofs](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/fundamentals-of-zero-knowledge-proofs) (the course I completed).  High‑level introduction; accessible to both developers and non‑developers.
- **ZK‑Learning.org** – [Zero Knowledge Proofs MOOC](https://zk-learning.org/), a free university‑style course taught by leading researchers.
- **Porter Adams’s ZK live stream series** – A multi‑part YouTube series exploring ZK circuits and protocols【895355980139095†L170-L196】.
- **CoinGecko & Jarrod Watts videos** – Introductory videos explaining the Ali Baba cave example and other metaphors【895355980139095†L116-L125】.

## Tools & libraries

- **Noir** – High‑level language for writing zero‑knowledge circuits. See [noir-lang.org](https://noir-lang.org/).  Great for beginners.
- **Circom** – Circuit definition language for SNARKs.  See [docs.circom.io](https://docs.circom.io/).
- **SnarkJS** – JavaScript library for generating proofs and verifying SNARKs.  Repository: <https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs>.
- **Halo2 / PLONK** – Modern proving systems from the Ethereum community.  See the [awesome-zero-knowledge-proofs](https://github.com/matter-labs/awesome-zero-knowledge-proofs) list for implementations.

## Open source projects to explore

- **zkSync** – Layer‑2 scaling solution using ZK proofs.  [Repository](https://github.com/matter-labs/zkSync-era) and [docs](https://era.zksync.io/).
- **ZK‑SNARK Example** – [ZoKrates](https://github.com/Zokrates/ZoKrates) provides a toolbox for zkSNARKs on Ethereum.  Try out the “sha256 preimage” example.
- **ZK‑EVM** – Explore the [Polygon ZK‑EVM](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm) or [Scroll](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits) implementations for advanced study.

## Communities

- **Cryptography Stack Exchange** – Ask technical questions and get answers from cryptographers and developers.
- **Cyfrin Discord** – [join here](https://discord.gg/cyfrin) to discuss courses and Web3 security.
- **ZK Hack** – periodic hackathons and study groups organised by [ZKHack.dev](https://www.zkhack.dev/).
